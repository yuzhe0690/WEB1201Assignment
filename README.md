**# WEB1201Assignment**
This is the final project of the web fundamental course, I am tasked to create an educational website regarding a topic. 
I had chosen to do an educational website about depression since it has been a common mental health issue in recent years and it is severe.
There is an interval between the update of the code as I had moved my code to repl.it since it is easier to host my website there and I did not make any changes to the GitHub version

The link to the website is here: [https://web1201assignment.yu-chengcheng9.repl.co/index.html](url)

**# About the Website #**
Within the website, users can be educated:
- about depression (facts and descriptions).
- about symptoms of depression.
- about ways to prevent or deal with depression.
- about ways to receive help or help someone with depression.

**# Features of the Website #**
- PHQ-9 Questionaire (from another website).
- Get Help, allows users to navigate to NGOs dealing with mental disorders or mental health issues.
- Contact Us, allows users to leave a message or feedback with their contacts.
- Donate Us, is a dummy button since I don't know how to implement a payment method at that time or doing this project.
- Login, which allows users to log in to the website and it has some basic input checking and management even though there is no database linked to this website.
- Register, which allows users to make an account for the website and it also has some basic input checking and management even though there is no database linked.

**# Goals of the Website #**
1. Educate people about depression.
2. Enlighten users with depression through colors.
3. Scalability, the website should be able to work as intended for all devices.
4. Performance, the website should be able to work on all devices without experiencing any lag.
5. Security, the website should have some fundamental error checking, input management, and information encryption.
